package Manikin_Software {
    class LogicaCreator {
        Description:
        This class will create the logical
        input for the ControlClass, that will 
        create the pattern of the movements etc,
        according to the measurements from the sensors
    }

    class Control {
        Description:
        This class will control
        the ChestClass and the CompressionsClass
        according to the logic input.
        The logical input will be 
        chosen according to the measured 
        values from the sensors
    }

    class Chest {
        Description:
        This class will have the control
        of the motor that will make the 
        chest moving. The pattern off the
        movement will be chosen from the ControlClass
    }

    class Compressions {
        Description:
        This class Uses the incoming datapoints
        to control the Chest Compression with the Motor class
    }
}

package Manikin_Software_Libraries {
    namespace Actuators {
        class Motor {
            Description:
            This class will control the motor
            that should move the chest of the
            baby. The class will get input from
            the ChestClass to make certain

        class Pump {
            Description:
            This class wil control the pump

            input from the ...Class to determine 
            the pattern of the airPonmbing 
        }
    }
}
