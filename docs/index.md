# Introduction

This repository contains open source firmware for several modules of the Manikin.

Everything began as several loose half-broken programs, after a small discussion it was clear that this wasn't the way forward for this project.
That is why we made this repository and decided on making big (working and tested) firmware releases for every module of the Manikin. 

Another thing that bothered us was the documentation, well the lack of...

This Wiki is made to provide documentation for the several firmware releases of the Manikin modules.
